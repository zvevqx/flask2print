# ✴ Waste Pedagogy


*![](/static/img/top.png)*

## 1 / Waste is a category/construct - a name given to an intellectual, physical or affective encounter - produced by wider structures and institutions.

The modes of waste we expand on take place in the context of active collective thinking, research and writing. Creating waste is a process of sorting, picking, choosing, and/or of placing value upon ideas and issues. We might understand waste-making as a resistance to plurality and discord amongst thinkers and ideas. 

> <mark>value - beyond usage value >> academic waste yes academic waste too (spaces of excess which also alludes to outside of traditional academic economy, something along the lines of desire perhaps)</mark>

*If the production of waste is a necessary impetus for the delineation of what is ‘productive’, ‘valuable’ and ‘useful’ in brainstorming, the line between waste-non-waste is always context specific and in flux.* We approach waste as a category that is produced by both the researcher and the institution. **How can we access these mounds of waste to give way to its political/liberatory elements? What happens when we find value in what is already used and marginal and we fail to act as expected by the larger social consensus/system of knowledge?** 

> <mark>It is tempting to think of this in terms of supply chains and pipelines - how waste and rubbish is organised  and who does this work (and position of waste in economy)? Parallels with radical pedagogy, rejection of banking model (its relation to economy and the marketisation of research).</mark>

## 2 / Waste as a breach between what you think is academically expected and what your initial thought,research question or curiosity is.

Systems of knowledge production within learning institutions encompass how and which questions are posed and the possibilities that they must always exclude. 

> <mark>It got me thinking, is rendering always the same as producing? Can we render something non-productive?</mark>

Being-with waste opens to a practice of attention, experimentation and invention. *Where we might usually discard a feeling about a research question,* **how could we hold on to that sensation in order to question our positionality in research?** What does it mean to follow and question a feeling of discomfort?

## 3 / Waste as free-association: it is letting yourself be guided by an image, a smell, a feeling or word into another thought that is somewhat further away from that first encounter.

To work with and through waste is to attend to the texture of thought in its multiplicity of perceptions, affects, and immediacy. To refuse a center and instead inhabit peripheral spaces. *Thought is textured: always more than intellectual-theoretical, an archive of experience, both past, present and immediate. The texture of thought is a culmination of conscious and unconscious affects, both bodily and intellectual.

> <mark>Thinking of the adage, “one man’s trash is another’s man’s treasure”, but also of the lost labor that ‘waste pedagogy’ implies, perhaps in opposition to brainstorming (where that loss is implicit/automatically accepted).</mark>

Can our collectivity embrace and bring together all the ‘debris’ of our experiences, the things that were felt but unsaid between us?* 

> <mark>How do you relate Waste Pedagogy with time, specially with the idea of wasting time?</mark>

## 4 / Wasting is a rupture in the tempo of thinking.

There is a temporality to the act of discarding. As thinking is kinetic, a rupture in the tempo of thinking is echoed in the body. *Perhaps engaging with these breaks we refuse to re-enter what would be a continuous and seamless thought-process.* We identify that working through waste encompasses mental labor, intellectual and emotional anxieties driven by academic trends, theoretical visibility, competition…

## 5 / Waste as an error, irrational, divergent, decadent, the non-fruit of labor. A silence, a bodily posture, and/or constellation of supposed ‘peripheral’ affects to be brought back to the centre. 

> <mark>How has working with waste affected your process with each others' ideas - but also the way that you view other material practices?</mark>

**How can we expand from affects and thoughts that would otherwise be considered disruptive?** *When interrogating the potential of debris we are exploring the space of what remains in a research. How can we retrace these processes of erosion? How can we reassemble the scattered traces in the always peripheral space of waste, a space that cannot be rationally organized?* Waste pedagogy can be unsystematic and open-ended to amplify the in-between space between thinking, feeling and knowing.

## 6 / Waste as collective and always relational.

> <mark>how much are you drawn towards / repelled from a consensus - seeking drive when consolidating waste theory as a collective?</mark>
