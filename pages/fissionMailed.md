# FISSION MAILURE


**ZONE_01**

**POINT OF DEPARTURE**


What opportunities does an expanded probing and cartographic recalibration of **_networked behaviours_** within the context of cultural production and consumption open up for publicly accessible and disseminated research models?



**ZONE_02**

**TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT**


The sliding registers of public access and engagement in the context of cultural production and consumption began to transmute during the pandemic forming a contra-flow to the traditional, universally static constructs and superstructures of solid state audience / cultural institutional relations.

Privileging online, networked formats and events and spawning a plethora of so-called alternative, distributed curatorial strategies publicly accessible cultural production has become scaled and distributed as highly amplified and viral artefacts swarming across the digital commons .

Granular scrutiny is urgently invited towards these prefab assumptions of the superiority of the democratising promise of distributed engagement and myopic utopian rhetoric around the merits of multiple points of public access and distributed modes of curatorial authorship and sovereignty.



**ZONE_03**

**Call & Response**

A kind of responsive blueprint: taking the form of a series of  **“Mutable Prototypes”** I am producing a discrete series of wave sets to probe and interrogate the oppositional states of transmutation and recursivity of distributed public cultural production and consumption.

A collection of quasi-imaginaries and speculative circuitry of new modes and models of networked behaviours my research-as-practice finds its location in close and stimulating dialogue with The Whitechapel Gallery and CSNI.

**ZONE_04**

**MUTABLE** <mark>**PROTOTYPES**</mark>

Taking on the language, form and attitude of prototyping I will develop a series of **_Mutable Prototypes_** that are fashioned and shaped to act as dynamic **_Minimum Viable Products_** or **_Semi-stable Research Objects_**_._

<mark>**Prototype - I wonder how this is described - doesn't it necessarily contain a lot of the qualities you describe? How to evaluate what goes on, what is learnt? how does it become research? how does it inform a further form?**</mark>

<mark>**(Ruben's point comes close to this)**</mark>

<mark>**Failure is built into scientific method for instance.** **.**</mark>

Each prototype will be enacted within a discrete set of conditions which will be tracked through cartographic events.

**ZONE_05**

**PROTOTYPE AS BODY & FISSION MAILURE**

**The FIRST : PROTOTYPE AS BODY**

A techno feminist rooted positioning of prototype as body or fluid, embodied research object.

Taking Astrida Neimanis’s _bodies of water_ as feminist figurations as a comparative structure, the <mark>**Mutable Prototype**</mark> casts my responsive research object as an assemblage; always in-the -making, involved in a ==**constant process of intake, transformation and exchange.**</mark>

<mark>**fission mailure is a _built in_ failure. designed into the structure of the game for the game to exist.**</mark>

<mark>**what would a game look like & feel like that had no end, no fission mailure? just went on and on with no end. ((would) either the playing body or machine would fail at some point (?))**</mark>

<mark>**what would anything look like with no failure? does academic research pretend to there being no failure? how does this affect the tone & possibilities of such research?**</mark>

<mark>**in which other situations is the very real possibility (probabiliy) of failure denied/suppressed?**</mark>

<mark>**also interested in unintended failure alongsdie intentional built-in fission mailure - both within the gaming environment & outside it.**</mark>

Reflecting Braidotti’s stance on figurations as “living maps” these <mark>**Mutable Prototypes**</mark> are seeded through specific situated contexts and take on active cartographic resistance to and fluid probing of public research contingencies and recursions.

**2] FISSION MAILURE**

**The SECOND:** **FISSION MAILURE**

Takes its cue from the function of the classic **_Fission Mailed_**  story event in a gaming environment.

Fission Mailure occurs when the reaches its conclusion and the player appears to have lost. The <mark>**“Game – Over”**</mark> music plays and a spoonerized version of Mission Failed [ Fission Mailed ] invades the screen.

<mark>**Thanks for sharing your work! I must admit, I was sometimes faced with my own failure of reading when going through your paper; some of the sentences simply outlasted my short term memory. However, I found inspiration in the object of your research; I embraced my own failure and moved on to the next level of reading by iteratively re-reading these sentences, as if I had been faced with the Game Over screen. I do have a question as well. I wonder how far you are taking the allegory to video games in your research. In video games, as you say, fission mailure is a decisive plot device that in no way breaks with the larger goal of the game. The failure (or mailure) actually points to the _success_ of the game. In your work, do you also believe that these generative failures you work with are really evidences of the success of another structure, and if yes - which structure is this? Should we refuse this larger structure or bask in its glory? If the failure is a designed 'plot device' in academia, where does the plot lead? And to what extent can we affect the plot (in most games, the player only has limited abilities to affect the plot)? All this reminds me of Shira Chess' exploration of queer gaming which refuses the very idea of a plot following the Freytag model - and perhaps you are getting at something similar?** [**https://doi.org/10.1080/15295036.2015.1129066**](https://doi.org/10.1080/15295036.2015.1129066)</mark>

However, the game is not over and this plot device is usually deployed to destabilize the gamer’s perception of their position within the gaming environment and question if they can trust the system and continue to follow the construct, reality and rules of the game. They have to appear to have failed in order to progress to the next level.

Fission <mark>**Mailure**</mark> acts as a mode of impeding sense-making within traditional

<mark>**How do you address the issue of the iterative erasing and cancelling of failure?**</mark>

research production and facilitates the re- imagining of alternative modes whose end goal is not to defend its position or to feed into a particular canon, but instead to throw light on the possibility of a mutable, porous and responsive research mode in a constant state of iteration and active multiple perspective witnessing, sensing and building .
