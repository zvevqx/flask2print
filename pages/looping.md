On 22 October 2020 the Polish Constitutional Tribunal announced a de facto abortion ban. Protesters took to the streets in hundreds of cities and town across the country, and abroad. The almost daily Strajk Kobiet [Women’s Strike] protests lasted over three months. 

When organising protests we – loosely-speaking, activists – would now and then try to find a moment to breathe and to ask ourselves: 

> *Is what we are doing effective? Is this the right strategy? What are we demanding? Where is the movement heading?*

In the eye of the storm, however, there is rarely enough time to sit down, take a step back, and to reflect. 

This research is happening against a backdrop of digitised-mediatised politics and a fascistisation of politics globally, looking to address an urgent need for dynamic renderings and more structured looping of research, arts, archiving and the streets, in the fight for better futures.


## *harnessing shifting narratives*  *radicalisation, intersectionality, affect*

***radicalisation*** The prolific use of swear words and words like ‘war’ and ‘hell’ on the one hand, words like ‘revolution’ and ‘care’, and the usage of ‘strike’ as a synonym of ‘demonstration’ on the other, signalled a shift towards more radical feminist thought in this protest wave as compared to previous ones.

***shifting narratives*** In the early days, many people celebrated policemen and -women joining the protests. As the weeks went on, the police were deployed to brutally suppress the protests which was widely documented, and the OSK [Ogólnopolski Strajk Kobiet / All-Poland Women’s Strike] leadership changed its stance and adopted the anti-fascist slogan *"Zdejmij mundur, przeproś matkę" ["Take off your uniform, apologise to your mother"]*. If this shift was possible, were others possible too?

## ***performing protests***  *displays of heroism and weak resistance*

These protests were marked by a particularly strong and coherent visual and sonic identity. The line between artist and activist can be fluid, as can the interaction between strategies (= theories) and methods (= practice).

Various artistic interventions served different purposes: creating a sense of belonging and community, (re)claiming public space, sparking moments of collective joy, keeping people warm and motivated, furthering a political message. 

Additionally, the digital mediatisation of this movement and the affective potential of artistic interventions meant that many had a huge resonance beyond their ‘analogue’ existence. Many were planned with the digital audience in mind. 

***displays of heroism*** Part of the fight was to reclaim national(ist) symbols: by using the red flare of 11 November (Independence Day) participants, writing new words written to a known football chant, restaging a national epic drama, dancing a traditional dance. 

> Drivers applaud. Gays Dance the Polonaise. [2]

Performing national(ist) symbols can (re)claim space, but this is loud and heroic. Should we be trying to (re)claim the system that oppresses us? 

***weak resistance*** Ewa Majewska argues for the building of counterpublics of the common and a focus on weak resistance. Small acts that build community, through participation and shared ownership. Humorous protest signs, creating sonic fictions through chants and song, organising spaces for healing, caring, sharing. Feeling the protest and its legacy in your (individual and collective) body.

Is this tactic more fitting for a broad movement trying to fiction a better future?

## *role of the archive* *alternate methodologies* 

*Is archiving research happening in real-time? What is the role of the archive? Do archives also perform?*

***living archives*** Archiwum Protestów Publicznych [Archive of Public Protest] is a photographers’ collective, which documents protests and collates material in an online, open source archive. In 2020/21 they began printing ‘Strike Newspapers’, made up of slogans, testimonials and photos, which could be used as mobile exhibitions, held as protest signs, or plastered in public spaces.

On 30 October 2020, a group of activists (artists, students) mounted a spontaneous installation of protest signs on the grass outside the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, which they called ‘Las Transparentów’ [Forest of Protest Signs]. The Museum distanced itself from it.

***institutions*** The same Warsaw Museum of Modern Art opened an exhibition in November 2021 as part of which they displayed protest signs from 2020/21 in a white cube gallery space. 

The Gdańsk Museum put out a call for ‘souvenirs’ from the demonstrations ten days after the protests began with the call: *"What will future generations say about the protests in 50, 100, or even more years’ time? Will material evidence of the protests survive in the future? Who should be keeping it?"*


## *Final words*

The aim of this research is to loop it back into spaces for political organising. Both artists and activists task themselves with an imag(in)ing of better futures. Knowledge-making is one step, and ways of rendering is another. This is a task that is not only _interesting_ but is also _existential_, as we search for answers to how to change the fascistic course that the Polish as well as many other global political elites are on.
