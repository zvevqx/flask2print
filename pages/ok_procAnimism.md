<mark>Questions from the workshop</mark>

<mark>- Is it a way to describe a behavioural pattern that includes a mode of resistances, a gap or tension? Or is it an approach to analyse and understand relations? Or both?</mark>

<mark>- To me this part makes sense, where you say: “Procedural animism is a symptom” - “out of alienation and impoverishment of experience produced by platforms.” So, it is a way of looking at things (a method? an approach?), but also a symptom of smth. Perhaps "Symptomatology of Collective Knowledge and the Social to Come" by Paolo Vignola could be a useful reference in elaborating the idea of animism as a symptom?</mark>

<mark>- I agree. Also the idea that something can be constructed to include/display this. So it also becomes an aesthetics.</mark>

# Procedural Animism: Rendering Through Collective Questioning


If we take *being human as praxis* (McKittrick 2015), how does it unfold in the networked space shared by humans and non-humans? The rational subject of Western modernity has long maintained itself by creating the distance between itself and human Others, by carving out their outlines as irrational and backward (Mignolo 2000) and by over-representing the Western conception of Man as a universal one (Wynter 2003, 257). In the digital space, the categories of *‘less-than-human’, ‘more-than-human’* and *’non-human’* are conducted through sub-minimum-wage online gigs, CAPTCHA tests and bot-detecting software. The digital subject in itself is ‘neither a human being not its representation but a distance between the two’ (Goriunova 2019, 128) and is *‘employed by various forms of power to distinguish, map and capture not only subjectivities, but also non-humans and physical things that inhabit the world’* (Goriunova 2019, 127). In this framework, turning our face to non-human participants of the networks  reveals many different Siris, Alexas and Tays: bots, virtual assistants, automated scripts, NPCs and ‘AI-powered’ customer services, with whom we not only co-exist but which we get angry at, appreciate, admire, interact and even compete with.

Procedural animism is a suggestion to refuse a reductionist view of these relations and to turn to the space where our so-called rationality encounters the algorithmic processes and things. Procedural animism is both a symptom and a potentiality. The animist desire arises out of alienation and impoverishment of experience produced by platforms, out of the profound impoverishment of contemporary social and political life, and reaches towards alternative ways of existing within contemporary networks. As a state of *‘being-in-a-medium-of-communication’* (Franke 2017), animism conjures new relations to Others and their images; even more significantly, these relations are primarily channeled through images. The images are flickering spirits, portals through which we constitute our relationality. For this reason, procedural animism resides strongly in affects and energies that are captured and spirited away by the algorithms of attention economy, by flows of images that become the capitalism's hiding place.

Procedural animism also emerges as resistance to capture, alienation and dehumanisation. In the case of conjuring algorithmic Others, it seems that asking 'what is it like to be a bat?', imagining 'entities' ontologically, is bound to recreate the existing sets of relations. We can see this in the critiques of dominant anthropocentric AI imaginaries, from fembot assistants, robotic caregivers and pets to helpful automated services, revealed as already gendered, aestheticised and racialised in particular ways. The cyberfeminist approaches, however, consider the human - non-human as an unstable boundary, and its redrawing - as a political gesture. As feminist sci-fi writers and STS scholars know, any procedure has a potential for being instrumentalised against its original aim, towards *‘the hard labor of alienation, which includes understanding the logic of instrumentality, politicizing it, and transcending it through usage itself’* (Majaca and Parisi, 2016).

How to address being non-human as praxis? My suggestion for conjuring is to start with describing a world, a political formation in which such alternative algorithmic entity is possible. To start with _conjuring_ a sociopolitical fabric in which alternative relations between non-humans and humans can take place. Procedural animism, then, is a movement towards the modification of reality-systems, in which a gesture of conjuring is a gesture of making possible: such modification is always already a change of the shape and length of the distance between the human and its algorithmic Other.
