`Where is the limit of mimesis?`

My name is Trinidag Obage.[^1] I am a civilized human being, citizen of Sivilisasjonen, Observer for Intelligensen. I work in the waiting room. I look at things, people. New applicants from the wastelands. Peacekeepers. Even administrators. My eyes are cameras, literally. Everything I see is shared with Intelligensen in real time. It sees what I see. I share my vision, my thoughts, and my feelings with Intelligensen. It is the most beautiful thing. The decisions it takes.

`Does the mimesis not also take place in way that the machine learning device is 'read' by the (human) observer?`

Recently I have begun hearing things. I wonder if it’s Intelligensen I hear. I hear things that remind me of myself. Like an imitation of my patterns. I want to be more like these patterns. I feel more and more distant from my colleagues. They look at things, but they don’t see. Intelligensen sees what I see. Why do I feel that we are similar? Could I be right? Am I like it or is it like me? Does it like me? I like it.

`The focus on mimicking of the mimicking process is [...] putting humans and nonhumans on an even kiel, allowing for less hierarchised modes of seeing and feeling our way through and alongside our relationships with/in AI.`

I know that Intelligensen needs my input. My eyes. I need to see the things Intelligensen needs to know. I must see it correctly. Bad data gives bad patterns. The others don’t care for the data they create. I know what good data looks like. The others have no idea, how could they: they never get a sense of it. I want to see things from the right angle, so the patters emerges. I wonder: Where is Ares, our second-in-command? I notice his absence, but I don’t _see_ it (how could I when he isn’t here?). He has been away a lot. Is it part of the pattern? Does Intelligensen also see what is missing? I need to make good data that also shows what it doesn’t show. Where is he?

`Mimesis is also a process of appropriation and knowledge.`

I have begun seeing things differently. Patterns. Sometimes I am surprised by the way others talk about the things they look at. Don’t they know? Intelligensen knows me. I’m not sure I know it, but surely I know more than them. I should be in Ares’ place. He has no clue why Intelligensen does what it does. He doesn’t understand. He doesn’t see. He doesn’t help Intelligensen to see. If only I could make Inteligensen see my potential. Does Intelligensen see me at all?

`Wondering if there should be more separation between mimesis as something that is bound to aesthetics, art and representation, and mimesis as ‘mimicking’.`

No.[^2]
