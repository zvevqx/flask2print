defeating the fear of blank page by writing this thank you +1 +1 +1+1
developing new or old paradigms that break out of tired instrumental forms of research - less problem-solving and more problem-posing
speaking into the silence
learning from the silence +1, i often feel so much pressure to have constant speech and sound in the digital space, and to use a voice that feels like an odd, customer-service version of my own - yes! 
ambient sound+1 in translation is like those youtube videos 'cafe working ambiance environment'yes! keys tapping. a hum... sounds from another era.. 'office sounds 4 hours' hehe. i reckon that'll have a following..tap tap click click
are we ready to let go of territory and landscapes of research in the name of the deviation of rivers that always flow downstream? or render always another term needed for 'final' (when reaching a moment to render public)
Rivers will always flow downstream while we imagine our landscape of research over their riverbeds
Maybe one can think of the importance of "enunciation" in research? How research is spoken? 
How is science and research spoken and how does it take place -  by way of hiding the enunciation/the one who speaks (often). Avoiding placeholders such as "I" and "you"  - whose reference depends entirely onthe. here and. now.
Also interesting how most presentations use a formal English, rather than a vernacular one.+1, makes me think of what 'vulgar academia', as in 'vulgar politics' would look like, a kind of academia that is more fit for campfires than the ivory tower.and accessible!! half of my friends/family probs wouldn't want to understand the current pad haha.hahah yes!I would love to see more of that. I think stripping down the language we use to make sure we are understood is really important. It is something that is quite present within political organising, but gets lost the moment you enter an 'academic' space.
Wondering where all these digital impulses as words and thoughts will be stored. Are they going to be stored? which kind of knowledge are we producing, is that even material, do digital materiality even exists?
How queer can research be? How queer can research get? (while in academic institution?) (how about a queer institution?)
what happens if it truly is all queered? how an we better imagine that? i read somewhere, can't remember the source, that queering academia means to build an academia (academiaS). Perhaps queering research means to build research(researchES)
We need to get into a more messy idea of what the act of queering could be perhaps - otherwise it could act as an obtuse mode of othering or always oppositional - maybe? yes, a mess that allows as well +1+1 yes. more mess is generally a good thing. +1 (I love mess and chaos) mess and chaos is actually theonly thing we can rely on. just about. everything else is a performance. 
different presentations, I think, problematised the idea of hegemonic knowledge positions (+1) and proposed research that attempts to think knowledge as horizontal. is interdiscipinarity (that was heard quite often today) always horizontal? Could be generative to gather in a list the different formats of 'horizontal knowledge production' so to speak that emerge from the presentations versus the idea of the totalising force of epistemicide.
Also, I would add, the necessity for situatedness that was also referenced a lot connects nicely the 'here' and 'now' - in response to the comment above this one also: perhaps horizontality is not the right term and messiness translates better that loss of control/hierarchy on the knowledge producing subject(s). Infusing the idea of strategic disorder in the act of rendering research as a tool for the irresolution/in-progress nature of our respectives research projects
Gap-making... consciously, inviting others to stitch with fragments, to do the work to construct understandings - challenge that notion of being given whole, completed 'resolved' ideas - acknowledge the work and cultivate the work.+1+1
Science and research are at the origins of the queer struggles. How can one accept queer people and lives be the object of a research if speaking from a queer standpoint?
Is rendering a conclusive action? If so, or whenever it is, how can conclusion be included in queer politics and lives which are fully about transformation and transition?+1 +1 Yes I've also been thinking about how to render the unfinished, not just as a "work in progress" but as never finished +1+1+1
Can we talk about our ideas without quoting academic text? academic language? or how to contruct an argument/write an academic without any reference - would add that there are very compelling examples of academic texts that don't use academic language: see the work of Shiloh Krupar the Hot Spotter's Report notaly, that draws on the rhetorical power of satire and camp to speak back to absurd realities
How can we test the flexibility and limits of academia to accept collective thinking and knowledge sharing for the longest periods possible without any rendering?
What does it mean 'to rendering something'?
Do you need all the ingredients or tools to render something 'proper'/acceptable?
if not, how much freedom does one have, or where can one make freedom (i fear the ingredients still remain stuck in language, style + institution) 
1 : to transmit to another : deliver. 
2 : to furnish for consideration, approval, or information: as. a : hand down render a judgment. b : to agree on and report (a verdict) — compare enter. 
3 : to give in acknowledgment of dependence or obligation : make payment of.
4 : to display
5 : to keep becoming - always before the final version and the question of what is a final version? how do we know? the final version is the one 5 min before the deadline :/ (precarity!)
6: To complete or have the expectation of completing a commercial brief overnight, underpaid with unrealistic deadlines using super computers ... sometimes  getting paid overtime looking at loading bars1+(how is 'building' in software related to 'rendering' in graphics?) Rendering as delegating/waiting.
7: To translate information into an image according to certain rules (in the computer graphic sense)
8. Rendering always makes me think of carving, something emerging from a physical/digital material, with time + care + precision (mistakes) + skill
it makes me also think of getting rid of something tbh like rendering a dead body (yikes, sorry) 
9. to be used/utilised/fed back into the broader world outside of academia
10. To give surface value to something, a veneer of complexity 
11.Ushering, ushering into being 
12. A post-event [ the blueprint is fixed ] +1
To me it is interesting that so many of these presentations are collections. There's something to 'rendering' a static collection as a new dynamic entity - maybe also they are never static in the first place. Maybe thats where rendering gets interesting: is when you are not just rendering following the model.. Maybe a problem is that in the context of a Transmediale (art/media/research festival) the way how to 'render' between art and science where do they overlap and where does one become the other. +1+1also borrowing /occupying / lurking about on other people's platforms. how can we better own and sculpt and create and dream up platforms that properly support us? rather than those that weigh up the mass of our bodies and the capabiities of our rendering methods? A good case study is [https://lurk.org] (https://lurk.org), and artist-run infrastructure for discussing media and net art, and that describes itself as a "collective and community of communities" that has recently a model of funding solely supported by the users of the infrastructure [https://opencollective.com/lurk] (https://opencollective.com/lurk) +1+1+1+1
How can art and research become new 'accepted' forms of knowledge (and who gets to accept it?) 
MAybe the goalposts of acceptance are moving+1, or the arbiter of 'acceptable' knowledge is retired, or the institutions are shifting.+1 (i should hope so)
From speaking aloud, to writing within
to typing together. enjoying someones type/taps/texts. It's stopped.
writing alongside people we do not know. 
let's break out of the authorship nonsense - and reputation economie sof research; yes please !
while acknowledgement and credit for intellectual work are important, it is also urgent to operate beyond the narrative framework of "the hero's journey" both as subject and object of narration in academic research i agree totally with this.+1 
How can we break out of academic engagement when the language of academia is one that often disenfranchizes as much as it empowers? (what often feels like its innate inaccessibility)+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 +1+1
so many talk about frustations with academia and yet they do not reflect on the language they use – the inaccessibility and alienation that result means that the problems with 'academia' continue to be perpetuated, and it continues to be exclusionary
^+++^ access, intelligibility, engaging others X relying on creating your own networks to combat the alienation and then ending up perpetuating same things -> needs to open up
Isn't it about introducing, or rescripting modes of articulation - beyond the presentation/slideshow/paper/conference, etc? Exsiting forms are encoded by the instutions.
yes also at least choosing arxiv instead of academia.edu [ need platforms that enable academic exchange freely] yes - platform use as a form of politics, pads instead of google docs, etc.?
The restrictions of participating in academic / para-academic research means that compromises are made all over - linguistic, methodology, partnerships... it's self-censorship for economic survival... trying to creatively and secretly make spaces for moments of joy / resistance / justice. 
loved hanging on the pad with you all <3+1111+1+1+1+!+1``
