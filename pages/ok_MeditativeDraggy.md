Every research presentation is a form of rendering. It is a performance, a vision, a provision, an exhibition, a re-presentation – of ideas, possibilities, opinions, and facts. Every research presentation is also a Sales Pitch. This Sales Pitch pitches and performs good rendering of research by a Researcher who is (put) in place (or who has put herself in place) to perform (as legitimately and convincingly as possible) her Value as a Researcher. She is also performing and proposing and pitching her worthy-of-the-investment of your time-ness. This requires good delivery. A good surrendering. A good melting down and a good first coat of plaster. With an invitation or a suggestion of what (colours, stories, narratives, additional voices) might be (deliciously or disastrously) layered on top of this. The rendering of research is a giving back, a storing, and a re-storing. And a handing down of one or more verdicts at once.

We are writing this on the train. I am writing this. I am sleeping. We are writing and sleeping alongside each other as the train brings us closer to where the Research Rendering will unfold. The events of the past few days, and weeks, and months even, have rendered us exhausted. I am writing this and I am wondering whether we will be able to render out our research well enough to gain your respect. If our giving is enough giving back. To you. To warrant your attention. For research is also an exchange. Your attention for this data. This data for your attention.

We would also like, very much, if you could take this Collaborative Rendering as an invitation to ruminate, reflect and meditate – both now and for a little bit beyond that. This is surely the wet dream of most researchers. That people who have been Close Contacts of the Research will feel they have been infected by these Research Fragments. And that that infection will last a while, and show up every now and then in casual and not so casual conversations. The hope is that the Research Fragments will be viral enough to morph, to change and be changed by each body and each voice that carries and transmits them. Each utterance or reference or re-membering of any Research Fragment trigger is a re-rendering that takes on some of these ideas, possibilities, opinions, and facts. And at that point the person picking up the Research becomes a collaborator in the ongoing ojorney of that research. The ongoing rendering. Research picks up meaning as it meets traction, purchase, friction and desire. Research is never done in a vacuum. Nor is reading. The reader is every bit as triggering for this research as the researcher who brought it together.

We believe in collaboration as a way forwards. Our collaborators are alive and dead and not yet born. They are human and not human. 

 

Under ideal conditions, collaboration with Researchers outside as well as inside the academy, would be the norm. The stage would be set - and conditions supportive of - play, exploration, experimentation, conversation across disciplines, languages, contexts, and generations.

We are asking how research can be more useful. And be a network that

Welcome to the SEMI-PAD!



*This pad text is synchronized to a Calibre-web installation, so that everyone viewing a pdf in the calibre library will also see this page next to it. This allows some collective form of commentary / note taking / etc. etc* 

 
*- useful - may be to think about in what ways and for whom?*

*\- really like the performative aspect of your presentation, it works for this kind of short 10 mins.* 

*\- thinking graspable vs accessible..*

*\- i am also interested in this kind of performative method, how it informs the rendering of research differently..*

*\- The discussion on how research comes about, what it is, how it is presented and where, is striking. From where does a research idea come about? What is the creative moment and how to present it? Where is the spark in knowledge - how to develop and present it? Understanding where an idea comes from.*

** 

*-perhaps differentiate between the "system" of research and the acts of research* 

*-also how important is "self-awareness" for the "generative" aspect of your approach (not the usefulness, but the generativeness?)*

** 

*I was really taken by the way you stage different voices - typographically, physically, visually, performatively, etc. And of course also conceptually, in the different understandings and meanings of what it is to render (to translate, to surrender, etc.)*

*In staging the voices, you also make us aware of the reader’s voice (our presence in your text). - the reader’s role in the rendering. And your call for a more affective relation to the research in this - a purpose beyond the usefulness of conventional/institutionalized understandings of research. Indeed, what makes rendering “good” (good surreindering, good translation, etc) becomes a much more open question.*

** 

*love the reference to hood feminism - as a way of collapsing the academy and lived experience* 

*it was very affective in the sense of the presentaton representing the feelings connected with questioning the 'usefulness' of research or future-planning – it's a very beautiful way of presenting questions regarding rendering - and in a way if it's beautiful, is that in itself a use?*

** 

*would say that your oral presentation is much more effective than the written rendering and I understood / felt the sense of it much more than through the text – the act of doing research vs the presenting of research seem quite separate and through the presentation it feels we are in the research process*

** 

*- the question on which voices render which research*

*- the act of research vs. the outcome (paper, PhD, etc.)*

** 

*On a note: There is a longer hisory of (marxist) research that emphasizes an element of collaboration - the collaborative research with workers and unions – from factory workers in the textile industry (early. industrialization) to workers to IT workers (how IT can/should be introduced to the workplace - based on the lived experiences of the workers, alienation to work, etc.). Your presentation is also interesting in relation to this - thinking of the conditions of knowledge work in academia - and the lived experience of this.*
