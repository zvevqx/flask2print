### Vectors in Translation: Rendering Supply Chains Research in Digital Space

**The question is not “what is a supply chain?” but “how can we learn how to learn about supply chains?** Rendering supply chain research requires abandoning the logics of totality and instrumentality in favour of developing heuristic techniques that shift the question from ‘what is a supply chain’ or ‘what is the supply chain of x’ to ‘how can we learn how to learn’ about supply chains. In contrast to the epistemic rigidity of asking “what is a supply chain” from the perspective of one particular field, learning how to learn invites acts of translation across disciplines and ways of knowing.

**Collaboration and plurality in existing supply chain renderings** In surveying the information landscape of how supply chains are rendered, we found that projects operated with different levels of epistemological and informational openness: some projects embrace epistemic diversity, but are closed by way of being presented as finished. Others are open in the sense of allowing on-going crowdsourcing contributions, but epistemically closed in their setting of parameters for what information counts as a valuable contribution. The range of projects that operate in this landscape varies starkly –– in fact, to such an extent that we often wondered if translating between all of them was still possible, or if they were inherently incompatible.

**Rendering supply chains in digital space raises dilemmas about epistemic value** Rendering supply chains raises the challenge of demonstrating their planetary scale without resorting to abstraction and erasure of difference. In designing digital tools that can help us to learn how to learn about supply chains, how do we address the question of data? Should the comparison across entities that data enables – and the standardisation it often entails – take precedence over heterogeneity, an important characteristic that renderings of supply chains often seek to present as seamless? Should rendering the recognisable company as a unit of analysis (Apple, Amazon, etc.) take precedence over making visible the vector[^1] of production and circulation (subcontractors, transportation logistics) that they control? Finally, how can we insist on the value of patchy, partial, and non-comprehensive information – perhaps in opposition to the existing standards of “missing”, “low-quality”, or “low-accuracy” data? Can the development of digital tools be designed to decrease reliance on standardised and quantified information, and instead make space for the partial, temporary, incomplete, patchy, and heterogenous?

**Maintenance as Research Ethos** With this in mind, we returned to the information landscape of supply chains research – realising that our place within it should perhaps be not a new, novel contribution – a “gap” to be filled, a “niche” to be carved out – but rather a way of translating between these ways of rendering, and the lifeworlds that they imbibe. By working with what already exists, we see new relations of responsibility, reciprocity, and solidarity arising from the notion of ‘maintenance’ as opposed to ‘creation’ of knowledge. (Data) maintenance becomes a way of rendering research without pressure of novelty and competition, instead imbued with notions of care and collaboration at its core.

<mark>I like the articulation of different scales of 'use', 'usefulness', etc. However, does this focus mean that you want to position yourself in only _one_ kind of useful-/-lessness? Can your project not have different forms in different contexts, making the way for a more multiple character in your project? Also: To what extent do/can you control how other actors find your research useful/-less?</mark>

<mark>yes i was also really inspired by this 'useful for whom and in what context' / and the surprise factor when parties you hadn't considered would necessarily be interested (or would find your work 'useful') came in then almost as collaborators in the direction and directing of the project. You could almost imagine how a project like this could grow to develop (picking up more collaborators as you go) in several directions at once, becoming its own supply chain & network in a way..</mark>

<mark>I think it is really interesting to think of “the vector economy”, and also research, as ‘a world of logistics’ - and of how thinking of it as a supply chain – opens our understanding of it in new ways (including its elements of labor, organisation of labor (in software, protocols, etc.), and so on). It sort of emphasises the increased role of a "managerial science of logistics" in software (including in areas that you'd not usually think of as 'logistical').</mark>
  

<mark>I wonder what existing studies of logistical software bring to this - of SAP e.g. and the works of Ned Rossiter? (who e.g. phrases globalisation as "supplychain capitalism")*
*(e.g this article: [https://nedrossiter.org/?p=380](https://nedrossiter.org/?p=380) ... he studies "how software driven systems generate protocols and standards that shape social, economic and cross-institutional relations within the global logistics industries."</mark>

<mark>I really appreciate your presentation and the way you articulate the change of focus you had from the original concept of supply chains. Regarding the dynamic or agency of Scale it might be interesting to speculate around a non-linear trajectory of scaleability in order to reveal some of the more arbitary elements you are concerned with?</mark>

<mark>When you talk about openness, to what extent are you mirroring the reflexive critique of FLOSS and the move to federated networks - the fediverse - not openness as such (alternative imaginaries of supply chains perhaps).

<mark>I really like the presesentation and the way you talk about the dilemmas. I found the tension around openness and accessibility is interesting, and how to be less reductive in terms of the presentation of results..</mark>

<mark>The bug/glitch is often used as opportunity to look into the infrastructures that would otherwise have stayed invisible. The current "glitches" in the supply chains of eg. chips, perhaps provides an interesting oppurtunity to engage with these infrastructures.</mark>
