# Editorial "Rendering Research"

This publication serves as a record of the workshop *Rendering Research* with contributions by Alexandra Anikina, Christian Ulrik Andersen, Vítor Blanco-Fernández, Yasmine Boudiaf, Geoff Cox, Malthe Stavning Erslev, Rachel Falconer, Hanna Grześkiewicz, Clareese Hill & Elly Clarke, Lee Tzu Tung, Kyveli Mavrokordopoulou & Agnès Villette, One Research Collective (Andrea Macias-Yañez, Séverine Chapelle, Caterina Selva, Giovanna Reder, Sanjana Varghese), Søren Pold, The Re:Source Project (Anne Lee Steele & Miriam Matthiessen), Winnie Soon, Pablo Velasco, Ruben van de Ven, Sheung Yiu. It was organized jointly by Digital Aesthetics Research Centre, Aarhus University and Centre for the Study of the Networked Image, London South Bank University and is a collective exploration of how we make our research public, and the forms it can take through speedy hands-on making. In this sense, it explores ways of collapsing the traditional workflows of peer review and academic publishing (typically taking many months to reach its public by which time its currency is questionable), drawing more closely together work in progress and feedback, writing and print production. It is part of an iterative process that began online late 2021, with early ideas presented at transmediale festival for art and digital culture in January 2022, and further developed in March 2022 as part of a 3 day workshop at École de recherche graphique in Brussels. Subsequently, longer versions of these texts will be developed for the open access online journal APRJA at https://aprja.net/.
