**Personal Statement**  
I don’t want to participate in any more conversations about AI ethics.

**Three Themes**
1.  Refusal: I’m not going to talk about autonomous weapons without first talking about white feminism. I’m not going to talk about medical diagnostics without first talking about colonial extractivism.

2.  Epistemic Justice: Dominant powers have determined what kinds of knowledge are valid and constructed institutions that crystallise stale thought.

3.  Amusement: Seriousness is inadequate, and for me, unsustainable.  
    
**The Platform**  
The [AI Justice Matrix](https://aijusticematrix.com/) platform invites the perspectives of practitioners concerned with the mechanics of knowledge formation that affect our relationship with technology. It treats all sources and expression of knowledge as valid. It offers issues to consider when contemplating AI practice without necessarily offering an answer.

**Policy Craft Is Futile**  
Recently proposed AI regulation, such as the European Council’s draft Artificial Intelligence Act has fallen short of upholding fundamental rights due to its stunted scope. Asking technology companies to self-regulate is even more hopeless, as we saw when Google’s own ethics board was disbanded merely two weeks after its launch. The entanglement between state institutions and private technology companies means that policies are made in the interest of capitalism, not the public.  

**Flawed Knowledge Produces Mediocre Ethicists**  
It is impossible to fully document what has been taken away from humanity by imperialism. However, it is possible to critically interrogate what we are left with. The suppression of intellectual potential in non-white people happens through various means, including stratification, categorisation and the redefining of how knowledge is performed. By design, any contributions that do not conform to the verisimilitude prescribed by the dominant powers, and therefore the contribution’s originators, are rendered inferior.  

**AI Ethics Through A Racial Justice Lens**  
The universality of whiteness-as-goodness provides a useful entry point into conversations on AI ethics. Whiteness is not static; it is attributed to groups of people and behaviours in varying degrees and under different circumstances. “They’re just like us” is a characteristic assigned to groups with a high degree of whiteness. Conversely, a process of othering is applied to those who do not conform to that mercurial ideal. This constant renegotiation of whiteness in public discourse is a demonstration of our ability to adapt personal and collective value systems to the changing properties of the subject being interrogated. This can in theory can be applied to new technologies. AI by its nature is likewise unstable. Its shifting definitions, applications and effects on humans and more-than-humans similarly demands an approach unrestricted by rigid ethical frameworks that manifest as stale policy.

**Collective Authorship as Intervention**  
The AI Justice Matrix is fundamentally a critique of the individualist, Euro-centric epistemological process that manifests as a curated flow of information passing though sanctioned knowledge keepers. It is an ongoing process of enquiry that exists in the commons, shaped by contributors concerned with the relationship between technology and society. The outputs will be determined by the community that is forming and it will continue for as long as it is sustainable.
