# Inconsistent maps; refusing projection

This text tells a coming to terms with the contradictory logic of mapping and map making as a mode of getting to know our research subject. Maps are valuable tools to examine relations of power[^braidottiCartographiesPresent2011] as they translate problems into spatial terms. At the same time, maps have long been analysed as knowledge objects laden with power.[^kitchinRethinkingMaps2007] The map's consistent projection of input to output —of pinpointing an entity to a fixed position in the multidimensional coordinate system— creates an illusion of neutrality. However, as maps only project certain aspects of the data and its structure, they do not represent but rather create the world. <mark>I always think of what is INSIDE/OUTSIDE [ what / who / when / where are in or out ]  mapping and how we can maybe start to boundary raid between the two.</mark> They take a position while they do a “god trick of seeing everything from nowhere.”[^harawaySituatedKnowledgesScience1988] How then can we respond to the hegemony of projection in making and rendering our maps?

As to respond to the rigidity of data projection we embrace the inconsistency of paths and pathfinding.[^molComplexitiesIntroduction2002] <mark>A reference on maps vs paths is obviously Michel de Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life where he also talks about strategy vs tactics. He also writes about metafor as transport, but maybe it is rather methonymical.</mark> Instead of projecting our data onto a two-dimensional plane, into a three-dimensional space, or even an n-dimensional hyperspace, <mark>refusing the map is such a political claim, that got me thinking about abandoning "the politics of verticality" (Weizman, Steyerl, Farucki).</mark> we erase the projection from the equation and let go of any pre-defined coordinate system.

We propose a practice of diagramming[^soonAestheticProgrammingHandbook2020] that, while still being confined to a two-dimensional surface, resists consistent projection. <mark>The alternative rendering you propose is, indeed, a queer one. Have you thought about approaching it froma queer phenomenology standpoint: from dissorientation, failure, strangeneess?</mark> Concretely, we will ask various professionals to describe our object of research from their professional perspective. During the interviews we ask each of them to draw a diagram of the entities, institutions, and processes they mention, and the connections between them. We do not merely record the final drawing and present it as a self standing object that represents how things are. Instead, in order to be able to capture the diagrams over time, we created a time-based vector format, and interfaces for drawing, and annotating the diagrams. <mark>What is the role of the mapping tool in the conversation - how it not only is a design for diagramming, but in some ways also "designs" the use and the user?</mark> We turn the attention to the unfolding of the diagram, to its process of becoming. The strokes cannot be seen independent of the conversation that brought them into being. <mark>All this makes me think of Niels Egebak's notion of 'anti-mimesis', in which Egebak explores the possibility of an aesthetics (and most of all a mode of critique) that enables us to encouter our own processes of meaning-making (and unmaking, I would add) in the meeting with art objects. In this endeavor, Egebak zooms in on the notion of 'palimpsest', a practice of leaving traces of earlier versions of a work in the finished work, thus pointing to the creation process in the thing itself.</mark>

Although we should be careful not to fetishize the affective quality of a hand-drawn diagram as opposed to that of a computer generated map, their “sketchy” nature suggests their status as conceptual aid. “The diagram here is a strategy of experimentation that scrambles narrative, figuration—the givens—and allows something else, at last, to step forward. This is the production of the unknown from within the known, the unseen from within the seen.”[^osullivanDiagramPracticeDiagrammatics2016]
<mark>In Deleuze and Guattari’s work on diagramming they outline how the diagram describes a process of territorialization - and of entanglement of thought and imagination and also reasoning. Are there any tensions in this? In what ways does “diagramming” as a (philisophical) practice reflect the software practice/engineering of visualisations/and diagraming in this proces?</mark> Every practitioner inevitably brings their own (visual) referentiality. These diagrams are exploratory devices. As the drawing progresses, space grows and shrinks, transforms from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, or is suspended altogether. <mark>I like the specific notion, or the language, of diagramming, referring to some sorts of geometric relationship which is often seen as logical and mathematical (like flowcharts) but it can be speculative and experimental. The tension between logical and imaginative is something I found particularly fascinating.</mark>

Moreover, diagramming allows for a composite practice in which drawings from different frameworks, can be superimposed on one another. <mark>how is the diagram incomplete? how would it be possible to create a diagram that is ongoing?</mark> The continuous reconfiguring of diagram composites might help us to work out possible relations and divergences between the various imaginaries. <mark>How do you see this kind of experimental and speculative diagramming might open up the ontological imagination of [your research object], and how can this type of destablizing knowledge generate new mode of inquiry and thinking in research?</mark> In their mutual inconsistency, the diagrams refuse the projection of a bird’s eye view. In other words, these diagrams are not different perspectives on the same thing, they allow our research object to emerge as more than one, while being less than many: it emerges as an _ontological multiple_.[^molBodyMultipleOntology2002] <mark>Just a propersition: To let one particpant analyze or read the diagrams produced by other participants. This would unlock other aspects of the diagrams than what you currently work with, making way for a more complete traversal of them. Seeing the diagrams also as things that are processual in nature, but which can also be parts of new processes, e.g. the process of analysis.</mark> It is by caring for, instead of rejecting, the contradictions and convergences of the various imaginaries[^puigdelabellacasaMattersCareTechnoscience2011], that we can attend to the politics that materializes between them. <mark>It is a move from matters of facts to matters of concerns and further to matters of care as a proposal for rendering research.</mark> <mark>What does it mean to care for contradictions, how does it work in practice?</mark> Any stability and coherence is a temporary state.
