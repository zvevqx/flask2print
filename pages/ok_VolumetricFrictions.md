# Volumetric Frictions. Rendering 3D Transfeminist Research

During the Rendering Research Workshop I presented the conceptual foundations and challenges of creating a virtual 3D space based on transfagbidyke/queer phenomenologies.
The core ideas of this project are: 
1) an increasing trend of (trans)feminist creators re-appropriating  of 3D aesthetics and vr towards new, pushing roads; 
2) the definition of current vr experiences as somehow queer by themselves (disorientation, being lost, strange embodiments, odd experiences of time and space);
3) the necessity of rendering research differently -and queerly-, away from the traditional PhD dissertation format. 

Rather than solutions (if there are any), in this text I focus on the main challenges and questions of this rendering research process. Here there is a mix of the interrogations i came to the workshop with, together with new questioning ideas that we collectively came up with during both transmediale festival and the workshop at erg.


**how to render research differently? and how render it queer?** transfagbidyke in academia/other institutionalized spaces of "knowledge" rendering? queering traditional formats of knowledge dissemination? <mark>not simply queer as subject matter but queer in form - how to queer rendering formats of academia?</mark> ---- <mark>queering the traditional dissertation format (yes!!</mark> ---- <mark>yes! how to queer the dissertation that's so true! and so important.</mark> ---- <mark>a form that is liquid, changeable in form - a direct challenge to the relatively fixed, solid forms that research takes - makes one think of other terms, dematerialise, fork, etc.</mark>


**is there a form for queerness? should be?** can we model it (in 3D)? representation/visibility/presence? queer as the "non-yet-conscious" (Esteban Muñoz)? how to model fludity and change? how to model open questions, rather than pre-defined answers? <mark>It seems to me that the tool or apparatus involved in such a process will have a lot of impact on the process itself. To what extent does the use of 3D modelling software also constrain the realm of possible representation in this regard, and thus also constrain the ways in which we can begin to see (or render) the not-yet-conscious. Does the not-yet-conscious always become conscious?</mark> ---- <mark>You propose a virtual space that is opposed to an "elitist" textual dissertation. My question would be, is a text not also a virtual space?</mark> ---- <mark>On a conceptual level, I wonder if the notions/metaphors of "model" and "rendering" act against the aims of the research (as in, e.g.  a 3D rendered model understood as a final version of 3d design) - or rendering as a constantly-changing process? not 3, but n-dimensions?</mark>

**is queer aesthetic anti-realistic?** what happens when we reduce queerness to an specific visual outcome? and if queer queers reality, is it anti-realistic? what are the relationships between queering reality and performing/transforming reality?  <mark>I see a parallel between 3D-modelling and computer vision: hyper-realism is the holy grail for 3D volumetric rendering in a similar way to that big data and visual turing test are the benchmark for computer vision. These benchmarks give superficial and easy evaluation of the technical performance of an algorithmic system while ignoring how these sytems often fail to represent the complexity of humanity. In the process, these systems reinforce the status quo.</mark> ---- <mark>Would it make sense to expand the (hyper)realist notion of 3D rendering to also address other hegemonic aesthetics in 3D rendering? What comes to mind is eg. the childish aesthetics of Pixar characters</mark> ---- <mark>Thinking that this is perhaps a new kind of (hyper)realism?  ("identitarian realism"?). And, realism doesn't have to 'look' real - per se. Perhaps what you present is 'realism' in the sense that it reflects (queers) the production of a particular reality(identity)? ... and presents the (production of a) reality of infrastructures/vr/volumetrics?</mark>

**queer identity politics in avatar embodyment?** checkboxes/multiple selection? different, more open ways, of avatar creation? <mark>How you will frame the practice of identifying with / creating / embodying / wearing / performing / living the avatars and characters. There seem to be many options for defining the relation between the virtual body and the “player”. There are some game studies approaches that speak about more traditional ‘player-character’ bonding, identification, empathy or even oppositional relations, but it seems exciting to see these relations in the queer studies light, perhaps as a kind of drag, or other gender-performative practices.</mark> ---- <mark>The refusal to refuse the presence and importance of the body (in) online (processes and experiences) is one that I too am looking at - alongside (trans)feminist perspectives and acknowledgements of the (queer) potential of shifting identities.</mark>

**how to build this queer vr experienced consciuoslly?** how to design it and make it work? (trans)feminist/free software/hosts? how to repair the damage done by extractive/privatized software and hosts? <mark>I understand you're rejection of the canonical rendering of "the traditional text format of a PhD thesis" and of traditional commercial software. Both are powerful and needs to be undermined, but maybe as with software there are ways of 'reducing the contradictions'. It might actually be quite powerful, to make/write your PhD thesis this way in a way that not only reduce but work with in and deconstruct some of the contradictions in ways that reinforce your argument? Don't let dichotomies overwhelm you - use dialectics to undermine them.</mark>

**other open issues** how to make a vr open to infinite queer experiences brougth into it by its users? how to create a radically open queer reality -without strict paths, borders or doors? what should be the relation of this project with academia/other institutions? how to build, mantain and take care of the queer communities needed to actually make this happen?
