# Nuclear Polders
## An artistic research in process

This text - fragments, impressions, incomplete answers - results from the Rendering Research workshop and interwieves questions/comments shared by participants of the Transmediale Festival and the ERG workshop with our initial essay.

*Grey skies, silent car rides, displacement, ruins, crisis, sunsets, smell of toxicity, smokestacks, industrial zone, pollution, wobbly grounds, beach, gulls...*

<mark>Polder landscapes will inevitably vanish over the course of the following decades due to water rise. Forming an eclectic nuclear geography on the shores of France, Belgium and the Netherlands lie 3 nuclear installations, all built on a polder: Gravelines, Doel and Borssele nuclear power stations were constructed around the same time, in the late seventies, on the unstable marsh soils of reclaimed land.</mark>

*A marsh as a ground is dynamic —indeed it constantly moves— and demands material and conceptual tools that respond to its transient character. The geological transience of such nuclear infrastructures is intensified by an epistemic one: while discussing with local nuclear activists in Gravelines, they stressed that the technology of the reactors dates back to the late seventies and the current generation of engineers is not equipped to deal with the reactors’ maintenance; especially so when it comes to issues related to sea level rise. In other words, along with the land, it is also the know-how of the reactors’ functioning that is getting lost. Thus, these nuclear polders become exemplary terrestrial grounds for the negotiation of both climate change and nuclear knowledge. We identify the imperative to archive these sites precisely at the confluence of land and knowledge loss.*

The following is a dialogue in process, with others and with ourselves:

*On some occasions you seem to make a rather binary technology/nature distinction. For example, when contrasting the "technological sublime" of the reactor with the "swampy, precarious soil". (...) I would argue that the soil of the polder is just as technological sublime as the reactor that stands on it*

Thank you for this comment. We are precisely trying to move away from these dichotomies that overdefine knowledge about the locations. Yet, the landscape constantly tricks us. It is engineered to precisely lure us into the fantasy of a nuclear wilderness. 

*How might these landscapes be changing in the face of war + climate change?*

This is a question we ask ourselves: How to accomodate and account for uncertainty in a research topic that is constantly mutating? How, to follow Emily Eliza Scott, could we ‘advocate for perspectives that are highly situated, yet move across registers and scales – both spatial (e.g. the so-called local and global) and temporal (e.g. historical time, evolutionary time, and media time)’?[^1].

*(...) how much resistance have you been finding because of the subject matter from institutions or official structures?*

A lot. We always thought it was because of the subject matter. But it wasn't. The interdisciplinary nature of the project seemed too challenging to different institutions.

*how to reflect the polyphony of actors?*

A possible way is to constantly acknowledge, and share, the epistemic contributions of our interlocutors. As such, they become co-actors rather than mere participants - the event-based format facilitates a frame that potentially invites multiple, and oftentimes contradictory, positions. This is something important in order to not reproduce the uniformity of expert nuclear knowledge.
