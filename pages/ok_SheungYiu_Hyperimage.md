#Hyperimage Index: Indexing, Mapping, and Collective Rendering  

In traditional publishing, index refers to an alphabetical list of subjects, usually arranged at the end of the book, with reference to the page they are mentioned; 
In the online context, indexing often refers to the method of injecting metadata and keywords for search engines to archive and retrieve websites. 

In both definitions, indexing is fundamentally a practice of cataloging, archiving, retrieving, organizing, and through that, making new connections. The term 'index-making' here refers to this practice and is not tied to any specific medium. 

Index is a close relative to glossary, codex, lexicon, mindmap and anthology in the sense that they cultivate connections and intertextuality. Index-making maps out the conceptual terrains of a new discipline for faster sense-making. 

Several contemporary research projects have appropriated the index format to catalog ongoing discourse in their respective emergent disciplines, such as *Cyberfeminist Index* and *A New AI Lexicon*.

Hyperimage Index is an online moderated annotated index for photography theory in the algorithmic age. 

Understanding the radical changes in algorithmic visual culture requires a transdisciplinary approach to visual studies and demands a new set of vocabularies and theoretical positions. 

Hyperimage Index surveys a wide range of literature and consults thinkers from different fields to collaboratively construct an atlas of ideas for algorithmic image-making. 

I propose collaborative index-making as a methodology of rendering research. 

Index-making benefits from the development of online platforms and the way it facilitates research—organization aesthetics. 

Online platforms facilitate collaborations and connections. 

Consequently, Index-making accelerates sense-making. 

Contrary to a monograph, index-making invites addition: new vocabularies, new contributors, new discourses, and new connections — a kind of real-time distributed theory-building. 

<center> *Online collective index-making is an alternative to the perfectly organized Western "museum": favoring disorientation, disorder, unexpected links.*</center>

The database aesthetic of indexing resembles the sense-making practice characteristic of contemporary algorithmic image systems – one that is based on networked image and inter-scalar seeing. 

From the aggregation of linked data points, a pattern emerges.
 
At the same time, individual data points reveal peculiarities and exceptions. 

<center> *The switching of scalar perspectives between the whole picture and individual thoughts when navigating through an index allows a complex understanding of a system in ways linear narrative cannot convey.*</center>

The question of 'the gatekeeper' then comes, as with all effort of indexing knowledge. 

<center> 
*Who gets to be included in the index? Who has the power to select?* 
*As a "digital aggregator", how much agency does the initiator have and is the curation distributed among participants in the index?* </
*How to accommodate diverse voices while maintaining a coherent perspective that makes sense?* 
*How to balance the index between completely free form and too restrictive?*

I have no answer. These are very valid questions my peer raised.
