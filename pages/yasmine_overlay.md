*I really appreciate and relate to your insistence on amusement to balance / to be in contrast to / present alongside seriousness.*

*I am not saying that the peer-review process is not valid, rather I think the whole journal culture creates a competitive and individualistic knowledge production process that I find at times detrimental to knowledge-making and at times obsolete compared to our network culture.* 

*Patterns and inherited bias may eventually be recognisible and is it always democratic and collaborative to open up a collective knowledge production framework or do we need more [un]design or [mis]intention behind so-called open structures?*

*Your criticism of policy is spot on, and makes me curious to hear about what kind of productive engagement the Matrix sustains.*

*For me, while the policy language / imagination is unsustainable and unproductive, it does a really great job of revealing the geopolitical conversation between the nation states that is still informing much of policy-making and cold-war style AI races and strategies, but is often overlooked precisely because it’s old school politics catching up with transnational corporate AI narratives.*

*Does using the concept of whiteness create a risk of recreating the colonial structures inherent to the term?*

*What are the reflections back on the institutions and structures, funding, in the way they affect the research itself?*

*How will interrogation take place in relation to the decentralised space you are creating? / do you equate interrogation with decentralised structure?*

*Is it meant to reconcile the different modes of engagement that people can have with the AI narratives/your project?*

*How to address the problems of gatekeeping in curation?*

*I like how discussions of "ethics" etc. so often associated with AI becomes a discussion of "epistemic justice".*

*I wonder what kind of (epistemic) knowledge the matrix contains itself.*

*From what I hear and read, the potential of the project is also raising the question about what power structures such as whiteness, rationality etc. imply and as a tactic continuously relating and thus decentering them.*

*I think that how you are thinking about whiteness as an ontological and phenomenological issue where whiteness is about a certain privilege, assimilation as Glissant would say filiation. Whiteness is a set of conditions and an orientation towards those conditions. You might like Sara Ahmed’s essay phenomenology of Whiteness which speaks about the positionality of whiteness.*

*Thinking that it would be very interesting to see the critique of specific rhetorical devices / phrases / specific language in policy-writing that prevents the meaningful translation into ethics.*
